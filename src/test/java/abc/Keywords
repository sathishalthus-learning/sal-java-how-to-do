//
STATIC
	- define variables , methods
	- belongs to class rather than instance
	- cant call a non-static variable in static method
	
ABSTRACT
	- used to indicate a varible, class, method is incomplete
	- abstract class cannot be instantiated, only subclassed
	- abtract method declared not implemented
		
	
FINAL
	- used to declare variables, methods, classes
	- variables - cannot change values once initialized.
	- methods - cannot be over-riden
	- classes - cannot be sub-classed(cannot be inherited)
	
THIS
	- refers the current instance of the class
	- often used to differentiate instance variables and local variables with same name

FINALLY 
	- is a code block associated with try-catch
	- is executed wether an exception is thrown or not

ACCESS MODIFIERS
	- PRIVATE - within the class
	- DEFAULT - to same package
	- PROTECTED - within package and subclasses in other packages
	- PUBLIC - can be accessed from anywhere
	
THREAD
	- sub-process in a program
	
SINGLETON
	-restricts to only one instance and provides a global access to that instance.
	- private constructor with a static method returns the instance.

THROW
	- used to throw a exception explicitly.
	
THROWS 
	-add a indication that a method may throw one or more exception
	
POJO
	- contains only private variables, constructors, getters, setters, without any business logic
	- provides simple way of encapsulation
